[![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/DistIL.OptimizerTask)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DistIL.OptimizerTask)

Post-build IL optimizer and intermediate representation for .NET programs.

# Installation and Usage
The optimizer is distributed as a MSBuild task via NuGet, [DistIL.OptimizerTask](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DistIL.OptimizerTask). It currently only targets .NET 7 projects.

By default, it will only be invoked in _Release_ mode and transform methods and classes annotated with `[Optimize]`.
It can be enabled globally by setting the `DistilAllMethods` project property to `true`, however that is not recommended because it could lead to unexpected behavior changes.

The IR and infrastructure is provided separately as a standalone library, [DistIL.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DistIL.Core). See the [API walkthrough](./docs/api-walkthrough.md) for details.

# Notable Features
- SSA-based Intermediate Representation
- Linq Expansion
- Lambda Devirtualization
- Method Inlining
- Scalar Replacement of Aggregates
- Value Numbering (ðŸš§ WIP)
- SLP and Loop Auto-vectorization (ðŸš§ WIP)

The project is stable enough to process libraries such as _ICSharpCode.Decompiler_ and _ImageSharp_ in full without crashing and without changing normal execution behavior (though unit tests may reveal some of them).

## Linq Expansion
This transform opportunistically rewrites Linq queries into imperative code in bottom-up order. It works by pattern matching and can only recognize a predefined set of known calls, which are listed below.

For [typical queries](./tests/Benchmarks/LinqBenchs.cs), it yields speed-ups ranging between 2-8x:

**Supported sources**
  - Special cased: `T[]`, `List<T>`, `string`, `Enumerable.Range()`
  - Fallback to any `IEnumerable<T>`

**Supported stages**
  - `Where`, `Select`, `OfType`, `Cast`
  - `SelectMany`
  - `Skip`

**Supported sinks**
  - `ToList`, `ToArray`, `ToHashSet`, `ToDictionary`
  - `Aggregate`, `Count(predicate)`
  - `First`, `FirstOrDefault`
  - `Any(predicate)`, `All(predicate)`
  - Loop enumeration

**Behavior differences**
  - `Dispose()` is never called for IEnumerable sources _(not implemented)_
    - Result may leak memory for sources such as `File.ReadLines()`.  
  - Null argument checks are removed
    - Result may throw `NullReferenceException` instead of `ArgumentNullException`.
  - `List<T>` version checks are bypassed
    - Result will never throw `InvalidOperationException` for concurrent modifications. On the worst case where lists are mutated by different threads, this could lead to buffer over-reads and access violations.

### Example
```cs
//Original code
[Optimize]
public float Aggregate()
    => _sourceItems
        .Select(x => x.Weight)
        .Where(x => x > 0.0f && x < 1.0f)
        .Aggregate(0.0f, (r, x) => r + (x < 0.5f ? -x : x));

//Decompiled output
[Optimize]
public float Aggregate()
{
    List<Item> sourceItems = _sourceItems;
    ref Item reference = ref MemoryMarshal.GetArrayDataReference(sourceItems._items);
    ref Item reference2 = ref Unsafe.Add(ref reference, (uint)sourceItems._size);
    float num = 0f;
    for (; Unsafe.IsAddressLessThan(ref reference, ref reference2); reference = ref Unsafe.Add(ref reference, 1))
    {
        float num2 = reference.Weight;
        if (num2 > 0f && num2 < 1f)
        {
            if (num2 < 0.5f) { num2 = 0f - num2; }
            num += num2;
        }
    }
    return num;
}
```

## Method Inlining
The inliner will aggressively inline any calls for non-virtual method defined in the same assembly, whose IL-code size was originally less than 32-bytes. Recursive inlines are not currently accounted for, and so this may significantly increase the assembly size and possibly cause performance regressions if the optimizer is enabled globally.

It heavily depends on `IgnoresAccessChecksToAttribute` in order to effectively inline methods accessing private members.

## Scalar Replacement
SROA removes simple non-escaping object allocations by inlining constituent fields into local variables.  
An object allocation is considered to be non-escaping if all uses throughout the method are from field related instructions.

### Example
```cs
//Original code
[Optimize]
public int GetMagic() => new RandomLCG(123).Next();

public class RandomLCG {
    int _seed;
    public RandomLCG(int seed) => _seed = seed;
    public int Next() => _seed = (_seed * 8121 + 28411) % 134456;
}

//Decompiled output
[Optimize]
public int GetMagic()
{
    return 86102;
}
```
